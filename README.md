## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I did not know how to color the eye icon, especially to have it change when hovered- because the fill property was part of the html (as default) I needed to add a class to the path which was styling the icon from the HTML.

### Continued development

This project is supposed to be only html and css, but it requires javascript to make the active state change image on hover or click, so of course I want to learn java
